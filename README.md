# Data Challenge 2019


## Project Description

**Individual Consulting Services**

Maryland Small Business Development Center (SBDC) provides free individual business consulting and group training to small businesses, both existing and pre-venture ones. The dataset lists businesses who received individual consulting services during the last 10 years (2009-2018) and includes

1. economic impact outcomes achieved by the clients as a result of consulting
1. consulting and training activity
1. characteristics of the businesses
1. socio-demographics of the owners

The analysis could help uncover factors that determine positive economic impact of business consulting and may include, for example, the following areas:

* Which (if any) socio-demographic, geographical, and industry (NAICS code) characteristics of pre-venture businesses do predict successful business start? In other words, are clients with certain demographics more successful in starting business them others? Are there industries with higher success rate? Rate industries by the percentage of clients who started business.

* What are the determinants of securing capital investments by the clients? Which of the available factors (if any) affect the amount of investments?

* Are there factors that predict increase in revenue and increase in the number of employees for existing businesses? If yes, what are the most important factors?
